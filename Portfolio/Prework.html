                    and football growing up but oncce I got out of school I started to just go to the gym to stay active which has lead me to bodybuild and powerlifrt and ive competed in both a few times now. I was alwasy interested in cars so once I got old enough to afford them
                    I started to buy and work on project cars. I have a Bmw Ive built for the track and a Silverado Ive built for offroading.
